# Climate Change Temperature Shift Analysis

This project aims to analyze the effects of climate change by comparing historical temperature patterns over a 50-year period (1950â€“2000) in a selected region.

The main idea is to:
- Use polynomial regression to model temperatures from October to April using data from 1950â€“1980.
- Compare this baseline model to data from 1980â€“2000 to detect temporal shifts in temperature patterns.
- Estimate how much earlier or later certain temperature milestones (e.g., reaching 10Â°C) occur, which may indicate changes in seasonal behavior.

The difference in predicted vs. observed temperature timelines can help quantify the extent of climate change in terms of days shifted per year.
